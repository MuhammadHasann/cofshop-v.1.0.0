Staffs are super friendly, smiling and welcoming with kindness. Loved the coffee and the hot chocolate. Great spot for coffee lovers and Starbucks fans üòâ",

I recommend getting there early, otherwise, there's always a long line. We got there pretty late in the afternoon so we had to wait about 30 minutes to get inside.",

Once inside service  was quick and extremely friendly. Staff seemed to enjoy working at this location.",
